"""
This module provides a set of functions for basic signal processing operations, including:

* **Framing:** Divides a given signal into overlapping frames.
* **Windowing:** Applies a Hamming window function to a frame.
* **Feature Extraction:** 
    * Calculates the energy of a signal frame.
    * Calculates the zero-crossing rate of a signal frame.
    * Calculates the autocorrelation coefficients of a signal frame.
    * Calculates the Average Magnitude Difference Function (AMDF) between two frames.
* **Signal Modification:**
    * Applies center clipping to a signal frame.

**Functions:**

* **framing(signal, frame_length, hop_length)**
    - **Args:**
        - `signal`: The input signal as a list of numerical values.
        - `frame_length`: The desired length of each frame (in samples).
        - `hop_length`: The number of samples to shift the frame window for each step.
    - **Returns:**
        - A list of frames, where each frame is a sublist of the input signal.
    - **Description:**
        - This function segments the input signal into overlapping frames. 
        - It iterates through the signal with a step size of `hop_length`, extracting frames of length `frame_length` at each step.
        - The resulting list contains all the extracted frames.

* **windowing(frame, window_type='hamming')**
    - **Args:**
        - `frame`: The input signal frame as a list of numerical values.
        - `window_type`: The type of window function to apply (currently only 'hamming' is supported).
    - **Returns:**
        - A list representing the windowed frame, where each sample in the frame is multiplied by the corresponding value of the Hamming window.
    - **Description:**
        - This function applies a Hamming window to the input frame to reduce spectral leakage. 
        - The Hamming window is a smoothly tapered function that reduces the influence of the abrupt signal discontinuities at the beginning and end of the frame.

* **signal_energy(frame)**
    - **Args:**
        - `frame`: The input signal frame as a list of numerical values.
    - **Returns:**
        - The energy of the frame, calculated as the sum of the squares of the signal values.
    - **Description:**
        - This function calculates the energy of the input frame, which is a measure of the signal's power.

* **zero_crossing_rate(frame)**
    - **Args:**
        - `frame`: The input signal frame as a list of numerical values.
    - **Returns:**
        - The number of zero crossings in the frame, where a zero crossing occurs when the signal changes sign between two consecutive samples.
    - **Description:**
        - This function calculates the zero-crossing rate of the frame, which is a measure of the frequency content of the signal.

* **autocorrelation(frame)**
    - **Args:**
        - `frame`: The input signal frame as a list of numerical values.
    - **Returns:**
        - A list of autocorrelation coefficients for the frame, representing the correlation of the frame with itself at different time lags.
    - **Description:**
        - This function calculates the autocorrelation of the frame, which can be used to analyze the periodicities within the signal.

* **amdf(frame1, frame2)**
    - **Args:**
        - `frame1`: The first signal frame as a list of numerical values.
        - `frame2`: The second signal frame as a list of numerical values.
    - **Returns:**
        - The minimum value of the Average Magnitude Difference Function (AMDF) between the two frames.
    - **Description:**
        - This function calculates the AMDF between two frames, which measures the similarity between the frames as a function of time lag. 
        - The minimum AMDF value indicates the time lag where the two frames are most similar.

* **center_clipping(frame, threshold)**
    - **Args:**
        - `frame`: The input signal frame as a list of numerical values.
        - `threshold`: The clipping threshold value.
    - **Returns:**
        - A list representing the center-clipped frame, where any signal values exceeding the threshold are clipped to the threshold value.
    - **Description:**
        - This function applies center clipping to the frame, which can be used to reduce the influence of large amplitude values in the signal.

**Note:**

* This module currently supports only the Hamming window function for windowing.
* The implementation of the `amdf` function calculates the minimum AMDF value, which can be used for tasks like pitch detection.
* The code includes basic docstrings for each function, providing a brief description of the function's purpose and its parameters.
